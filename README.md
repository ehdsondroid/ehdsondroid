## Hi there 👋

Hi! I'm Edward Benedict L. Pavia, a BSIT college student from STI Colleges, currently in 3rd Year – 2nd Semester. I’m naturally curious and enjoy learning how technologies, devices, and systems work behind the scenes.

I don’t claim to be an expert (yet), but I grow through consistency, persistence, and determination. I believe improvement comes step by step, and I’m committed to becoming better every day — with the goal of becoming a Software Engineer after I graduate.

## 🚀 What am I currently working on?

🎮 Our Capstone/Thesis Project, which is a game-based system
💻 Building simple websites through Web Development
🖥 Developing NetBeans UI projects
📚 Continuous self-learning in programming and system development

I have also:
- Created two games — one using C# (Lucky 777) and one using Python (Snake and Ladders)
- Developed the full documentation for a project called
“Student Violation Recording System” (App Development subject), which received high praise for its documentation quality

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies I Use

Languages & Development:
- HTML / CSS
- C#
- Python
- Java

Other Skills:
- Basic software troubleshooting (especially for printers and system-related issues)
Still improving in hardware troubleshooting, but actively learning

## 📫 How to Reach Me

I’m open to learning, sharing ideas, and having simple tech-related conversations. I like connecting with people who are also interested in technology, systems, and growth in the IT field.
